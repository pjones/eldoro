* Bugs
** DONE Point jumps to 0 when buffer isn't focused
   CLOSED: [2012-09-04 Tue 14:36]
   When the Eldoro buffer is in a window, but that window isn't
   focused, when the eldoro-update function is done running point is
   at (point-min) for some reason.  This doesn't happen if the buffer
   isn't in a window, or if the buffer is in the focused window.
** DONE Buffer is keeping undo information

   - Eventually you get a warning about too much undo information.
